# VHDL using a FPGA, Quartus, and ModelSIM

This is for a DE10 Lite Board and utilizes most of the functionality of the device including program counter, memory, CLAs, ALUs, sequential logic components, basic FSMs, registers file, instruction register, clock divison, R-type (operations on 2 registers), I-type (operations on 1 register and an immediate value), jumps, branches, load, and store instructions.

I am hoping to do more of this soon. Very similar code is easily found online so I am probably not releasing sensitive material. Credit to GS. Contact me if this needs to be taken down, please.
